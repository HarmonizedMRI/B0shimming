For those who would like to use the FSL brain extraction tool as in this example,
here are some installation notes.

Note that you will need about 12 Gb of hard drive space.

When installing using python that was installed by conda, python might not work with root privileges.


Please also note that  adding a few lines to my .bashrc file.
How to do it is already described on:
