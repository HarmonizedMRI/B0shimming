For those who would like to use the FSL brain extraction tool as in this example,
here are some installation notes.

Note that you will need about 10 Gb of hard drive space.

Please also note that you need to configure your shell as described here:

depending on what shell you use the changes might have to be done in ~/.bashrc

Then log out and back in to test the installation
